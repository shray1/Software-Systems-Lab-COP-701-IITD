You do not need to turn in the evaluation script in your submissions. Just upload your
submission i.e. A zip file containing the source code, header files and Makefile only.
Please do not upload any other files except the aforementioned files.


You have to follow the below instructions while evaluating your submission:

Step-1 : Place the submission in the submissions directory.
		(For demo purpose, there are already two submissions).

Step-2 : Open terminal inside the submissions folder or navigate into the submissions
	     folder and execute the following command, "unzip \*.zip" .

Step-3 : Come out of submissions directory and modify the paths in ssl_grade.py.
		 give the absolute path of the submissions directory, output directory and the trace directory.

Step-4 : Execute ssl_grade.py with the following command "python3 ssl_grade.py" and it will
		 grade all the submissions and save the scores in csv format (score.csv) in the same
		 directory.
